# COMP 2000 Set Exercises

### **High-Fidelity Prototype**

The implementation of the high-fidelity prototype for the employee side application. This allows the user to log in; view and edit their personal data; claim holidays; view their previous holiday claims and manage the notifications they receive from this application.

### Walkthrough

1. After entering the user's details, press the log-in button, to log into the employee side.\

 There is a navigation bar at the bottom of every screen after logging in, where the user can switch between the accounts and holiday screens as well as the log out button.

2. Once logged in the user will be on the account screen, where they can see their personal data. The user can then manage notifications or edit their data.
3. On the notifications sub-screen they can choose from a variety of settings to personalise their experience.  
4. If the user chooses to edit their data, they can update the values by writing over the previous data.

5. After selecting the holiday option for the navbar, the user will be able to see all of their previously claimed holidays (whether they are approved or denied), how many days of holiday they are still entitled to and a button that will allow them to book more.
6. Once the book holiday button is pressed, they can input the date they would like to take off and save their changes.
7. This date will then be added to the pending claims section on the previous window.



### Roadmap
- Further, refine the employee side by implementing greater security and the data being stored.
- Add the admin side of the application.
- Implement RESTful API
